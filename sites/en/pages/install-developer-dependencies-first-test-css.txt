While trying to enable GitHub Actions to the <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Test-CSS">Test-CSS</a> distribution I received the following error:

<code>
! No MYMETA file is found after configure. Your toolchain is too old?
Configuring /home/runner/work/Test-CSS/Test-CSS ... N/A
! Configuring . failed. See /home/runner/.cpanm/work/1665208338.1655/build.log for details.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
</code>

Surprisingly this only happened on Linux and OSX. On Windows, where we use <a href="https://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a> everything worked fine.

<h2>Showing error logs</h2>

The error message did not help much, so I added the following steps to the GitHub Actions configuration file, to display the content of the log files:

<code>
   - name: Show Errors on Ubuntu
      if:  ${{ failure() && startsWith( matrix.runner, 'ubuntu-')}}
      run: |
         cat /home/runner/.cpanm/work/*/build.log

    - name: Show Errors on OSX
      if:  ${{ failure() && startsWith( matrix.runner, 'macos-')}}
      run: |
         cat  /Users/runner/.cpanm/work/*/build.log
</code>

Pushing out the changes triggered another run of the CI and this time I could see the content of the log file in the "Show Errors on Ubuntu" step:

<code>
...

Similar output could be seen from OSX.

<h2>Developer dependency</h2>

I assume this is a developer-only dependency so I included it among the other modules we need to install for the author tests and moved the installation of them
before the installation of the run-time dependencies. The final configuration file is this:

<include file="examples/test-css-ci.yml">
